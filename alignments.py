# Below is a conceptual approach and a toy example of how one might extend the quantum-based QUBO/QAOA approach
# from a sequence alignment problem to a conformance checking problem between a single trace and a Petri net.
# This is not a fully scalable or production-ready solution, but it illustrates how you might encode the alignment
# and token-flow constraints into a QUBO. The resulting formulation can then be solved using Qiskit, similar to
# the previous example.
#
# High-Level Idea
#
# In conformance checking with Petri nets, we try to "replay" a given trace on the Petri net. If the trace
# is perfectly fitting the model, we can sequence the firing of transitions from the initial marking to the final
# marking exactly matching the trace events. If it is not perfectly fitting, we must introduce "model moves"
# (where we allow a transition to fire without matching an event) or "log moves" (where we skip or insert events)
# at some cost, aiming to find the minimal deviation alignment.
#
# This problem can be turned into an optimization problem. A simplified approach:
#
# 1. Given:
#    - A Petri net N=(P,T,F) with an initial marking M_0 and a final marking M_f.
#    - A trace of observed events σ = e_1, e_2, ..., e_n.
#
# 2. Variables:
#    We introduce binary decision variables to represent:
#    - Transition Firings: x_{t,s} = 1 if transition t ∈ T fires at step s ∈ {1,...,n}.
#    - Extra Moves:
#      - "Skip event" y_s = 1 if we skip the observed event at step s.
#      - "Insert model move" z_{t,s} = 1 if transition t fires without corresponding event at step s.
#
#    In a minimal example, we might start without explicit "insertions," just align each observed event to
#    exactly one transition (or skip it), and ensure the token game constraints are respected.
#
# 3. Objective:
#    - Match Cost: If e_s matches the label of t, reward choosing x_{t,s}=1.
#    - Mismatch/Deviation Cost: If no suitable transition matches an event, we penalize skipping or mismatching.
#
# 4. Constraints:
#    - One event matched per step (or skipped): For each step s,
#      Σ_{t:label(t)=e_s} x_{t,s} + y_s = 1.
#    - Token Flow Constraints: For each place p ∈ P and step s, define m_{p,s} as a binary variable
#      indicating if p has a token at step s. We have:
#
#      m_{p,s} = m_{p,s-1} + Σ_t in(p) x_{t,s} - Σ_t out(p) x_{t,s}.
#
#    Enforcing these constraints in a QUBO can be done by adding penalty terms for violations.
#
# 5. QUBO Construction:
#    - Add linear terms for matches/mismatches.
#    - Add quadratic penalty terms for alignment and token-flow constraints.
#
# Practical Considerations:
# - Complexity grows quickly; real Petri nets and conformance checking are more complex.
# - Binary token assumption is a simplification.
# - Large penalty constants and careful scaling are needed.
# - Only very small instances might be tractable on current NISQ devices.
#
# Example Code (Conceptual Toy Example):
# The code below illustrates the approach with a tiny Petri net and a short trace "A", "B".
# It sets up a QUBO for conformance checking and attempts to solve it with QAOA via Qiskit.
#
# Disclaimer:
# - This is a highly simplified and conceptual example.
# - Proper encoding for real cases may require more complex formulations and tuning.
# - The problem may become quickly intractable.
