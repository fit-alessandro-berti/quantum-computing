# Below is a conceptual outline of how one might approach integrating quantum computing techniques
# (for example, via Qiskit) into a process mining scenario, particularly for predicting next activities
# or remaining time. Note that this is an emerging area of research—there is not yet a standard,
# off-the-shelf solution. The following outlines one possible direction and methodology.
#
# High-Level Idea
# Process mining involves analyzing event logs—sequences of activities over time—to extract insights
# about organizational processes. Predictive process monitoring techniques often use classical machine
# learning or deep learning models to predict outcomes such as:
#
# - Next activity prediction: Given a partial trace of executed activities, predict the next likely event.
# - Remaining time prediction: Estimate how much time remains until a process instance completes.
#
# Quantum computing could offer potential advantages here in terms of handling high-dimensional
# state spaces, exploring complex sequence patterns, or leveraging quantum kernels for pattern
# recognition. One promising approach is to use quantum-enhanced machine learning methods, such
# as quantum kernels or parameterized quantum circuits (quantum neural networks), to tackle the
# classification or regression tasks at the core of predictive process monitoring.
#
# Potential Approach
#
# Data Preparation & Encoding:
# - Event Log Representation: Start with an event log consisting of multiple process instances (traces).
#   Each trace is a sequence of events (a1, t1), (a2, t2), … where a_i is the activity and t_i is the timestamp.
#
# - Feature Extraction: To predict the next activity, we can encode the currently observed prefix of the trace
#   into a feature vector. For instance, one-hot encode the activities and possibly include time-based features.
#   If we have a vocabulary of N possible activities, a prefix of length L can be represented as an N-dimensional
#   vector capturing the frequency or presence of certain recent activities, along with any additional temporal features.
#
# Quantum Feature Maps:
# Once we have a numerical feature vector, we can use a quantum feature map to embed these features into a
# Hilbert space defined by the states of a parameterized quantum circuit. Quantum feature maps can create
# complex, non-linear transformations that may lead to richer hypothesis spaces for classification or regression.
# Qiskit’s qiskit_machine_learning module provides quantum kernels and feature maps like PauliFeatureMap or ZFeatureMap.
#
# Quantum Kernel Methods (QSVM):
# For next activity prediction, consider this a multi-class classification problem. We can:
# 1. Encode each prefix into quantum states using a chosen feature map.
# 2. Compute the quantum kernel (overlap between quantum states) with Qiskit’s kernel functions.
# 3. Train a classical SVM using the quantum kernel to distinguish between different next activities.
#
# Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) for Regression:
# For remaining time prediction, we can use parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) as QNNs:
# 1. Encode the current process state into a quantum circuit.
# 2. Introduce trainable parameters in the quantum circuit.
# 3. Optimize these parameters to minimize the mean-squared error for predicted remaining times.
# Qiskit’s TwoLayerQNN or EstimatorQNN can be used for this purpose.
#
# Hybrid Classical-Quantum Models:
# In practice, a hybrid model may be most effective:
# - A classical neural network pre-processes and reduces complexity of the input features.
# - The reduced feature vector is then passed into a quantum circuit (quantum model) for final prediction.
# These can be trained end-to-end, leveraging classical processing power and quantum capabilities.
